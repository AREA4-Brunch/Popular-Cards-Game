# Popular-Cards-Game
Hope you will enjoy this fun card game website, for it to work there first needs to be a database named `qcardsdatabase` and initialised with SQL commands that can be found in `./databases_sql_create_commands.txt`. I used XAMPP.


Code, used for the style of sign in/up card on login page, in the file `./css/loginsignupform_style.css` is Florin Pop's and can be found at:

Due to possible future changes of libraries used for the halo animation of vanta.js I decided to download
current version and save it to a file `./js/vanta_halo_17_10_2021.js`. That code is licensed under a following MIT license:
